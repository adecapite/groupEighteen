            Thanks for accessing Flare, where help is only 3 clicks away. The purpose of this site is to connect victims of domestic violence with shelters and resources in the greater Columbus area. Simply choose one of the 3 categories (men, women’s, or children’s) and you will be redirected to a page that searches for shelters for men, women, or children. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Your safety is our number one priority, so we’ve embedded this information in an innocuous format, a website that buys and sells used clothes. This website should appear in your browser history as a used clothing store, and shelter locations are presented as “store” locations. The purpose of this user agreement is to provide you a discrete description of our services. Click the button on the cancel button to navigate quickly back to the user agreement section, however none of the text above or below this section are legitimate.
