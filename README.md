//Discreet Website for victims of Domestic Violene\\

## USER STORY

```
As a user I want a website that can be used as a discreet resource to find shelters for victims of domestic violence.
When I visit the homepage I am presented with a dropdown list categorizing options for women, men, and children. 
Then I am brought to a page that prompts for location to search for nearby stores. 
When I enter my location data. 
Then I am presented with locations for shelters near my location. 
When I view the shelter locations. 
Then I am presented with a list containing needed information to “sell items”. This should be the necessary documentation needed to sign in to the shelter. 
When I visit the homepage. 
Then I am prompted with a sign up button that brings up a user agreement that gives information about the purpose of the website.
