        Your safety is our number one priority, so we’ve embedded this information in an innocuous format, a website that buys and sells used clothes. This website should appear in your browser history as a used clothing store, and shelter locations are presented as “store” locations. The purpose of this user agreement is to provide you a discrete description of our services. Click the button on the right to navigate quickly back to the user agreement section, however none of the text above or below this section are legitimate.
